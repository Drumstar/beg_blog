========
I'm new to web technologies and just learning. You're welcome to make your corrections and notice for me. I'm ready to hear about all my mistakes and I'll appreciate it. I will improve my blog everyday with new features. Backend will be RoR and Frontend as usual HTML5/CSS3/JS(Jquery).
So I'm starting now 28-th of November. 5pm (UTC +2).
I will divide my work in a parts and each part I will describe here.
As an example I'll use http://chitwoodandhobbs.com/
My topics will be about programming and path from newbie to expert.
Good bless me!)
